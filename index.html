        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello, I am David! This is my HTML-only portfolio where I will be showcasing the work I have done following <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/?kw=complete+2024&src=sac">Angela's Web Development Bootcamp</a>.<p>
        <p>In the course so far, we were asked to learn a few of the fundamentals in HTML, such as using hyperlinks with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a">anchor elements</a>, sourcing images with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img">image embed element</a> and file pathing. The embedded hyperlinks will take you to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN Web Docs</a>, a useful resource I found to learning the basics of HTML and hopefully in the future, much more!<p>

        <h2>Project 1</h2>
        <p>In this first project, I was asked to rank my favourite movies in order, which includes the very basics, such as Headings, Paragraphs, Line Breaks and more. You can view this project fully by clicking on the movie icon below.</p>

        <h5>Note: I added some images/gifs to the Movie Project while creating this HTML project to make the project above a bit less bland.<h5>
        <h2>Project 2</h2>
        <p>My second project required me to create a birthday invitation. This project includes image elements, lists and clickable links! Click the cake below to view the project. </p>
